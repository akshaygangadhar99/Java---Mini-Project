# Java---Mini-Project  
- This is a mini-project developed by myself and Karan Punjabi (GitHub User ID - karanpunjabi18) as part of our Java course in Semester-2 of our MSc in Data Science program.  

- We are developing a Roommate Portal for the university students. The objective is to develop a fast and efficient system wherein students can check for available housing based on a number of filters such as pricing, distance from campus and room-sharing.  

- We hope this serves as a good foundation to help our university develop a real-time portal which can help smoothen the hostel-booking process in the near future.
